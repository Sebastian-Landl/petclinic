= Prompts for PetClinic UI Improvements

== GitHub-like UI
* Make the UI of this project more user-friendly and look like the GitHub UI.
* There is now a useless user button on the top right. Please remove it as there is no login logic.

== Dark and Light Mode
* Now implement a dark and light mode. Also implement a toggle in the UI.
* Hey not everything turns dark in the dark mode yet. The filter in the sub pages and the header of the results is still white in darkmode.
